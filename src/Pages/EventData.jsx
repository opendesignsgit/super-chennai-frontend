          Typically, these Raagas explore all the varying moods associated with the experience of the rains and are usually performed during the monsoon months. Built on this very essence, 
          Banyan Tree envisioned the concept of ‘Barkha Ritu – a musical celebration with the maestros’, developing a grand celebration of music that encapsulates all the emotions that the 
          rains evoke in us. A host of renowned artists have performed at this festival, and they have all had the opportunity to present their creative renditions of the Monsoon Raagas.
          Now entering its 24th year, Banyan Tree’s ‘Barkha Ritu’ has truly cemented itself as a celebration of the monsoons, also enabling the propagation of India’s rich intangible heritage.`,

      Typically, these Ragas explore all the varying moods associated with the experience of the rains and are usually performed during the monsoon months. Built on this very essence, Banyan Tree envisioned the concept of ‘Barkha Ritu – a musical celebration with the maestros’ -- developing a grand celebration of music that encapsulates all the emotions that the rains evoke in us. A host of renowned artists have performed at this festival, and they have all had the opportunity to present their own creative renditions of the Monsoon Ragas.
      Now entering its 24th year, Banyan Tree’s ‘Barkha Ritu’ has truly cemented itself as a celebration of the monsoons, also enabling the propagation of India’s rich intangible heritage..`,
